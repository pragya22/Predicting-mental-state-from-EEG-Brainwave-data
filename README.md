# Predicting-mental-state-from-EEG-Brainwave-data

With the use of metal electrodes and a conducting liquid, electroencephalography (EEG), a noninvasive technology, records electrical activity from the
scalp’s surface. Due to their simplicity of use and the quick feedback replies made possible by the high temporal accuracy of the EEG, Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies based on EEG data have been widely used. By examining an individual’s EEG patterns, it is possible to ascertain their mental state. These signals can be categorized based on their physiological characteristics to be utilized subsequently for the identification of a confused condition. Such a condition is characterized  by difficulties paying attention, thinking clearly, being disoriented, and having varying levels of attentiveness. An ANN model with 90.99% accuracy has been developed using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. An RNN model with 95.43% accuracy was used to enhance the classification results. Four metrics—Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model’s performance. The findings show great potential for wearable EEG sensors to distinguish between cognitive states in contexts with significant but subtle change.
